The xorxorxor challenge gives a file with an encrypted flag and the way it gets encrypted.

The program generates a random key with 4 bytes. Lets call the bytes k0, k1, k2 and k3.
Then it uses the key to encrypt the data by xoring the data with key. However the length of the key is only 4 bytes so it gets reused. 

d0 xor k0
d1 xor k1
d2 xor k2
d3 xor k3

d4 xor k0
..


We know the first 4 Letters of the flag (HTB{..})
So if take the first encryped byte we need to xor it with a byte that gives a H --> k0
same for T --> k1, B --> k2, { --> k3.

If we put this in a program we figure out the key and can decrypt the message.
